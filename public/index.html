        <h1>Why did we create Fluent?</h1>
        <p>
          Software localization has been dominated by an outdated paradigm:
          translations that map one-to-one to the English copy. The grammar of
          the source language imposes limits on the expressiveness of the
          translation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created Fluent to change this paradigm. Translators should be able
          to use the entire expressive power of their language without asking
          developers for permission. In Fluent, translations are asymmetric. A
          simple string in English can map to a complex multi-variant
          translation in another language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fluent makes it possible to cater to the grammar and style of many
          languages, independently of the source language. It happens in
          isolation; the fact that one language benefits from more advanced
          logic doesn’t require any other localization to apply it. Each
          localization is in control of how complex the translation becomes.

            <h2>The English Translation</h2>

            <p>
              In Fluent, most messages are simple text strings identified by an
              <em>identifier</em>. In the first message in the example,
              <code>tabs-close-button</code> is the identifier and
              <code>Close</code> is the value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes, translations require a little bit of logic to sound
              right in the target language. In the
              <code>tabs-close-tooltip</code> message, the correct variant of
              the translation depends on the value of the
              <code>$tabCount</code> variable. The names of the variants,
              <code>[one]</code> and <code>[other]</code>, are standard names of
              the plural categories defined by the Unicode in
              <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules"
                >CLDR</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, when no logic is required, translations in
              Fluent stay simple. The <code>tabs-close-warning</code> message
              appears in Firefox when the user tries to close a window with more
              than one tab. The message is only displayed when the tab count is
              2 or more, and so in English, the word <em>tab</em> will always
              appear as the plural <em>tabs</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>-sync-brand-name</code> is a special kind of message in
              Fluent, called a <em>term</em>. Term identifiers always start with
              a dash. Terms can be referenced by other messages, but cannot be
              displayed directly in the app. Referencing terms is a powerful
              tool for ensuring consistency. Once defined, a translation can be
              reused in other translations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>-sync-brand-name</code> term can be referenced from
              other messages, and it will always resolve to the same value.
              Terms help enforce style guidelines; they can also be swapped in
              and out to modify the branding in unofficial builds and on beta
              release channels.

            <h2>The Italian Translation</h2>
            <p>
              In Italian, the messages from the <code>tabs-close</code>
              family have a similar structure to their English counterparts.
              Even if the languages are different, the grammar requirements for
              these particular messages are similar. Fluent doesn't impose any
              additional complexity when it's not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The capitalization rules, however, are different in Italian than
              in English. Thanks to the asymmetric nature of Fluent, the Italian
              translation is free to define two facets of the brand name. The
              default one, <code>[uppercase]</code>, is suitable for standalone
              appearances (<code>sync-dialog-title</code>) and for beginning of
              sentences (<code>sync-headline-title</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, the <code>[lowercase]</code> variant can be
              explicitly requested by passing the
              <code>first: "lowercase"</code> parameter when the brand name is
              used inside a larger sentence in the
              <code>sync-signedout-title</code>
              message.

            <h2>The Polish Translation</h2>

            <p>
              The Polish translation illustrates how Fluent caters to yet more
              complex grammars.
            </p>
            <p>
              The imperative <em>Close</em> command in
              <code>tabs-close-button</code>, <em>Zamknij</em>, still remains a
              simple string, same as in English and in Italian. The other
              messages in the <code>tabs-close</code> group, however, require a
              bit more attention to sound well in Polish. It's related to the
              fact that Polish, a Slavic language, has more plural categories
              than English (a Germanic language) or Italian (a Romance
              language). For example, the Polish translation for
              <em>tab</em> takes a different form for counts of 2, 3, and 4 than
              it does for 5, 6, or 7. Hence, the
              <code>tabs-close-warning</code> message requires additional
              variants in Polish: <code>[few]</code> and <code>[many]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similar to how Italian needed to vary the forms of
              <code>-sync-brand-name</code> with regards to the capitalization,
              the Polish translation defines three variants of the brand name
              corresponding to three grammatical cases: <em>nominative</em>,
              <em>genitive</em>, and <em>accusative</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using terms inside sentences requires care in Polish, which is an
              inflected language. The Polish translation can reference the
              specific term variant corresponding to the <em>genitive</em>
              declension to construct a grammatically correct sentence in the
              <code>sync-signedout-title</code> message.

              <h2>The Arabic Translation</h2>
    
              <p>
    
                The Arabic translation is yet another example of how flexible Fluent can be, using the example of
                <code>few</code> and <code>many</code>.
    
              </p>
              <p>
    
                In this example we added a <code>tabs-count-full</code> variable
                that stores all the possible plural (textual) variations of the word
                <em>tab</em>. Arabic has
                <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/37/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#ar"
                  target="_blank">6 variations</a> for a numbered element.
                0, 1, 2, few (<code>3~10, 103~110, 1003</code>), many
                (<code>11~99, 311~399</code>) and other (<code>100~102, 200~202, 
                  300~302, …</code>).<br>
                After we prodive a definition for each variation all we have to do
                then is include it in our usual messages. This reduces the amount
                of work needed to be done by the localization community, by
                defining the 6 possible cases of a word in one place then calling
                it in any phrase without worrying about its integration status.
    
              </p>
              <p>
    
                For this example to work we had to alter the <code>min</code> and
                <code>max</code> parameters of the slider so it can put into
                consideration the cases of <code>many</code> like
                <em>11, 12, 18, …</em>.
    
              </p>
    
              <p>
    
                Also adding <code>dir="auto"</code> reorganized the variables
                to the correct order in our Arabic example since it's an RTL
                language.
