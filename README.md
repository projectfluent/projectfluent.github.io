projectfluent.org
=================

This is the source code of the [projectfluent.org][] website.

For GitHub to recognize this repo as the [Organization Page][], it needs to be
named `projectfluent/projectfluent.github.io` and the built files must be
committed to the `master` branch.  The source from which the website is built
consequently lives on the `devel` branch.

The `CNAME` file on the `master` branch sets up the custom domain,
_projectfluent.org_.

With this setup, individual repositories in the `projectfluent` organization
can deploy their own GitHub Pages which will be accessible at
`projectfluent.org/<repo_name>`.
