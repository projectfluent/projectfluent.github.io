See the documentation of the Fluent syntax for more\n * information.\n *\n * In case of errors the resolver will try to salvage as much of the\n * translation as possible.  In rare situations where the resolver didn't know\n * how to recover from an error it will return an instance of `FluentNone`.\n *\n * `MessageReference`, `VariantExpression`, `AttributeExpression` and\n * `SelectExpression` resolve to raw Runtime Entries objects and the result of\n * the resolution needs to be passed into `Type` to get their real value.\n * This is useful for composing expressions.
